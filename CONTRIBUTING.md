# Coding Conventions

Coding conventions in SPiFI are useful to keep the code consistent and readable.

When contibuting code the following coding conventions apply:
- skip 3 lines before a class definition.
- indentation is 4 spaces
- tabs are not allowed in leading whitespace
- open / close brackets for blocks must be on their own line and are aligned
  with the preceeding scope.
  ```groovy
  if (A==1)
  {
      // instructions inside block are indented.
  }
  ```
